"# Port_Review" 
<h2>To view the site Live go to :  </h2>
https://port-review.herokuapp.com/
<br>
<p> I had some trouble with my repo after I put the site live, so to combat this I  made a new repo for the heroku live site.</p>
https://github.com/KenKilmartin/Port_review_Live_Take2

<p>My first attempt did not go as well so decided to start it again </p>

<h2>** reminder to self **</h2>
<p>To enter cmd of site : heroku run bash -a port-review</p>
